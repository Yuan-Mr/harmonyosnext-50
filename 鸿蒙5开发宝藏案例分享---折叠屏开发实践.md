### 🌟 Best Practice Cases Unveiled! A Hidden Treasure Manual for Developers  

Hello everyone! Today, while flipping through HarmonyOS documentation, I stumbled upon a惊天大宝藏 (hidden gem) — the official team has long quietly released dozens of ultra-practical development cases covering core scenarios like foldable adaptation, performance optimization, UI frameworks, and cross-device collaboration! These cases are tucked away in the depths of the documentation but serve as genuine "productivity tools." Let's go treasure hunting together!  


### 🔥 Why Are These Treasures?  
The "Best Practices" documentation provided by the official team (path: Developer Website > Documentation > Best Practices) holds secrets:  
● **Full-scenario coverage**: From foldable hover interactions to PC cross-device collaboration, memory optimization to animation smoothness  
● **Real code snippets**: Each case comes with reusable core code  
● **Pitfall guides**: Solutions for高频开发问题 (e.g., fold crease avoidance, portrait-landscape断层)  
● **Design + code dual tutorials**: Even UX specifications are pre-defined  

Below, let's analyze several hardcore cases in detail 👇  


### 🚀 Treasure Case Battle Analysis  
#### Case 1: Foldable Hover State Development (Video Playback Scenario)  
**Pain point**: Foldable hover operation areas obscure content.  
**Official solution**:  
● Use `FolderStack` component to automatically split the screen.  
● Dynamically avoid fold creases via `getCurrentFoldCreaseRegion()` API.  

```typescript
// Hover state screen split + fold crease avoidance  
FolderStack({ upperItems: ["videoPlayer"] }) {  
  // Upper half: Video player (auto-avoids creases)  
  Column() {  
    VideoPlayer()  
  }.id("videoPlayer")  

  // Lower half: Operation controls  
  Column() {  
    PlaybackControls()  
  }  
}  
.onFolderStateChange((state) => {  
  // Automatically adjust layout on hover state changes  
  if (state.isHalfFolded) console.log("Entering hover mode!")  
})
```  

**Key techniques**:  
1. `upperItems` specifies the upper-half component ID.  
2. The system automatically handles fold crease avoidance.  
3. Real-time callback for hover state changes.  

📌 Effect comparison: Without adaptation, operation buttons are blocked by creases; after adaptation, the operation area sinks + the video shifts up for a silky experience!  


#### Case 2: Responsive Font Adaptation (Multi-Device Compatibility)  
**Pain point**: Text appears too large/small when foldables are unfolded.  
**Official solution**: Breakpoint system + `rem` responsive units.  

```css
/* Dynamically calculate font size based on screen width */  
:root {  
  font-size: calc(16px + 0.2 * (100vw - 320px) / 880);  
}  

@media (min-width: 1280px) {  
  /* Large-screen exclusive styles */  
  .title { font-size: 1.8rem; }  
}
```  

**Core principles**:  
● Breakpoint thresholds: 320px/600px/840px/1280px for four screen width gears.  
● `rem` dynamic calculation: Font scales smoothly with screen width.  
● Media query fine-tuning: Additional layout optimizations for large screens.  

💡 Test data: The same text displays at 12px in folded state (375px width) and 14.5px in unfolded state (840px width), adhering to human eye reading comfort!  


#### Case 3: Seamless Portrait-Landscape Switching (Video Full-Screen Scenario)  
**Pain point**: Excessive rotation during full-screen playback on square-screen devices (e.g., Mate X).  
**Black technology solution**: Vertical breakpoint judgment + forced landscape.  

```typescript
// Determine if close to 1:1 square screen (vertical breakpoint)  
const aspectRatio = window.height / window.width  
if (aspectRatio >= 0.8 && aspectRatio <= 1.2) {  
  // Lock to landscape orientation  
  window.setPreferredOrientation(Orientation.LANDSCAPE)  
}
```  

**Advantages**:  
● Prevents frequent device rotation by users.  
● Maintains maximum video content display.  
● Adapts to special ratio devices like Mate X/Pad.  


### 🛠️ More Battle Techniques  
1. **Multi-window adaptation**  
```typescript
// Split-screen mode listening  
window.on("splitScreenChange", (mode) => {  
  if (mode === SplitScreenMode.SPLIT_HORIZONTAL) {  
    adjustLayoutForHorizontalSplit()  
  }  
})
```  

2. **Fold state sensing**  
```typescript
// Get fold state in real time  
display.on("foldStatusChange", (status) => {  
  if (status === FoldStatus.HALF_FOLDED) {  
    showHoverModeUI()  
  }  
})
```  

3. **One-many layout secrets**  
```css
/* Single column on mobile → double column on tablet */  
@media (width > 600px) {  
  .news-list {  
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;  
  }  
}
```  


### 💎 Why Must Developers Read These Cases?  
1. **Directly solve business pain points**: E.g., image zoom limits for e-commerce apps, hover control bars for video apps.  
2. **Save trial-and-error costs**: Officially verified solutions avoid pitfalls.  
3. **Built-in design specifications**: UX standards are directly integrated into code logic.  
4. **Cross-device coverage**: One codebase compatible with phones/foldables/tablets/PCs.  

⚠️ Pitfall tip:  
Never use `deviceInfo.deviceType` to judge foldables!  
The correct approach is to listen for screen changes via `display.on("foldDisplayModeChange")`!  


### 🎯 Conclusion: Stop Reinventing the Wheel!  
These cases hidden in the documentation are like HarmonyOS development's "Swiss Army knife." Especially for foldable development, the official team has tuned everything from basic layouts to hover interactions, including performance optimization parameters. It is recommended to directly search the official website for "Best Practices" → "Foldable Development Practices," saving at least 50% development time!
